# How to prepare for this workshop

## Hardware and Software Requirements

Participants must bring a laptop to the course (not a tablet or chromebook),
and they must install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). You do not need to be familiar
with Docker, but you should be familiar with basic git commands. If you would
like to review git, we recommend the [Software Carpentry
Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) on it.


## Skill Required

Participants are expected to be modestly comfortable with basic data science
tools including git, the Unix shell, and Python. Expertise in git and the shell
are not required, but participants should be comfortable with, at a minimum,
basic Python syntax, the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library, and the
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library before registering for the course.
(If you are looking for somewhere to start learning Python, NumPy, and Pandas,
we recommend the [Software Carpentry
lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).)
