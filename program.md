# Workshop Program

The workshop will take place from 9am&ndash;noon each day from Monday October
27th through Thursday October 30th in the WRF Data Science Studio on the 6th
floor of the Physics/Astronomy Tower at the University of Washington.

Each day of the workshop will focus on a different topics. These topics are
additionally laid out in the [Lesson
Site](https://noahbenson.github.io/AI-ABCs/). They are as follows:
* **Day 1**. Unsupervised learning: tools for organizing and simplifying data
  that don't require one to have a specific goal or any examples of "correct"
  organization/simplification.
* **Day 2**. Supervised learning: tools that can model data but that require
  one to have some examples of what a "correct" model would predict.
* **Day 3**. Nonlinear models and optimization: tools for constructing one's
  own models and how to fit them to a datasets.
* **Day 4**. Neural networks and deep learning: tools that use simple linear
  systems to model a wide variety of data, including convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs).
